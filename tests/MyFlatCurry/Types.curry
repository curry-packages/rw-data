--- This library supports meta-programming, i.e., the manipulation of
--- Curry programs in Curry. For this purpose, the library contains
--- definitions of data types for the representation of Curry programs
--- in the MyFlatCurry format where all function definitions are
--- at the top-level and pattern matching is replaced by case expressions
--- and disjunctions.

--- Data type for representing a Curry module in the intermediate form.
--- A value of this data type has the form
---
---     (Prog modname imports typedecls functions opdecls)

--- `modname` is the name of this module,
--- `imports` is the list of modules names that are imported, and

--- data type, function, and operator declarations
--- contained in this module, respectively.

--- The data type for representing qualified names.
--- In MyFlatCurry all names are qualified to avoid name clashes.
--- The first component is the module name and the second component the
--- unqualified name as it occurs in the source program.

--- They are represented by `(TVar i)` where `i` is a type variable index.

--- Kinded type variables are represented by a tuple of type variable
--- index and kind.

--- Data type for representing definitions of algebraic data types
--- and type synonyms.
---
--- A data type definition of the form

--- is represented by the MyFlatCurry term

--- where each `ij` is the index of the type variable `xj`.
---
--- Note: the type variable indices are unique inside each type declaration
---       and are usually numbered from 0
---
--- Thus, a data type declaration consists of the name of the data type,
--- a list of type parameters and a list of constructor declarations.

--- Data type for representing function declarations.
---
--- A function declaration in MyFlatCurry is a term of the form

--- and represents the function `name` with definition

--- Note: the variable indices are unique inside each function declaration
---       and are usually numbered from 0
---
--- External functions are represented as
---
---     (Func name arity type (External s))
---
--- where s is the external name associated to this function.
---
--- Thus, a function declaration consists of the name, arity, type, and rule.

--- Data type for representing expressions.
---
--- Remarks:
---
--- if-then-else expressions are represented as rigid case expressions:
---
---     (if e1 then e2 else e3)
---
--- is represented as
---
---     (case e1 of { True -> e2; False -> e3})
---
--- Higher-order applications are represented as calls to the (external)
--- function `apply`. For instance, the rule
---
---     app f x = f x
---
--- is represented as
---
---     (Rule  [0,1] (Comb FuncCall ("Prelude","apply") [Var 0, Var 1]))
---
--- A conditional rule is represented as a call to an external function
--- `cond` where the first argument is the condition (a constraint).
--- For instance, the rule
---
---     equal2 x | x=:=2 = True
---
--- is represented as
---
---     (Rule [0]
---           (Comb FuncCall ("Prelude","cond")

--- @cons Comb - application `(f e1 ... en)` of function/constructor `f`
---              with `n`&lt;=arity(`f`)
--- @cons Let - introduction of local variables via (recursive) let declarations
--- @cons Free - introduction of free local variables
--- @cons Or - disjunction of two expressions (used to translate rules
---            with overlapping left-hand sides)
--- @cons Case - case distinction (rigid or flex)
--- @cons Typed - typed expression to represent an expression with a
---               type declaration

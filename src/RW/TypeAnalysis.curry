--- The position of a type variable in a constructor declaration
type VarPos = [Int]

rootPos :: VarPos
rootPos = []

--- Given some constructor Cn of type T
---   data T t1 ... tn = ... | Cn e1 ... em | ...
--- this type represents the assignment of constructor parameter positions 
--- to type variables. 
---
--- Examples: 
--- 
--- Consider 
---   data Either a b = Left a | Right b 
--- Then, the assignments for the constructors are
---   1. For "Left":  (0, [a, []])
---   2. For "Right": (0, [b, []])
--- 
--- Consider
---   data MyData a b = MyCons (Pair a b) 
--- Then, the assignment for the constructor is
---  1. For "MyCons": (0, [(a, [0]), (b, [1])])
data Assignment = Assignment QName [(Int, [(CTVarIName, VarPos)])]
  deriving (Show)

--- Given some type variable assignments, this function returns a collection of all type variables,
--- associated with their constructor and the position of the type variable in the constructor.
assignments2typeAccess :: [Assignment] -> [(CTVarIName, (VarPos, QName, Int))]
assignments2typeAccess = concatMap (\(Assignment cons poss) -> concatMap (\(i, poss') -> map (\(var, pos) -> (var, (pos, cons, i))) poss') poss)

--- For a given type declaration, this function generates a list of assignments.
--- The result is non-redundant and correct, i.e., all type variables are assigned 
--- exactly once. 
---
--- Consider 
---   data Foo a b c = C0 c | C1 (Maybe (Maybe a)) (Maybe b)
--- Then, the result contains 
---   - the constructor "C0" binding the type variable "c" to the position 0 ([])
---   - the constructor "C1" binding the type variable "a" to the position 0 ([0,0])
---                              and the type variable "b" to the position 1 ([0])
---   
--- The chosen type variable position can't be inside the type constructor of the same type. Consider
---   data MyLoop a = MyCons (MyLoop a) (Maybe (Maybe (Maybe a)))
---                                                         ^^^
--- Then, the type variable position is as marked.
---
--- Note that the varPos is stripped of the constructor parameter position.
--- 
--- Using the assignments, one can locate all type variables in the type declaration.

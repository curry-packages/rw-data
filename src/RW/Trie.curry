--- A simple trie data structure.
--- 
--- This implementation assumes that the keys are small. It is not (yet)
--- optimized for arbitrary keys. 
--- That is, no optimizations are done in regards to memory usage
--- (or access speed) when using different keys with unique prefixes.
---
--- Consider a Trie containing the keys a,b,c,aa,ab,ac:
---          root 
---         / | \
---        /  |  \
---       a   b   c
---     / | \    
---    a  b  c
---
--- This is fine. Now consider a Trie containing the keys a,b,Helloworld
---          root
---         / | \
---        /  |  \
---       a   b   H  
---               |
---               e
---               |
---               l
---               |
---               ...
--- This is an issue because lots of nodes without associated values are created
--- (only the leaf nodes a,b,d have values).
